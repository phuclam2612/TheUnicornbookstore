            <h2>By Lyla Sage</h2>
            <p>Lyla is a twenty-something hopelessly romantic who lives in the Wild West with her devoted friend, a nice, old, blind rescue pitbull. She writes romance that reminds her of her favorite things, such as sunshine and large blue skies. When she's not writing, she's usually reading about cowboys or hometown heroes, although she's also dabbled with mob leaders, monsters, and billionaires. You can typically find her in the mountains, under her warm blanket, or at her favorite neighborhood bookstore. Connect with Lyla on social media @authorlylasage, sign up for her newsletter, or visit www.lylasageauthor.com to stay up to speed on her upcoming projects.</p>
            <h2>Book description</h2>
            <p>Clementine "Emmy" Ryder has no idea what she's doing for the first time in her life. She has completed all of the tasks on her to-do list. She left her little community, went to college, and created a name for herself doing what she loved: horseback riding. But when an injury forces Emmy to face a challenge she can't overcome, she abandons a profession, an apartment, and a boyfriend to return to the place she's spent her whole life trying to avoid.

                Meadowlark's most infamous bad boy, bar owner, and bachelor is Luke Brooks. He's also the Ryder family's unofficial fifth member, having spent his whole youth opposing Emmy, the youngest Ryder sister.
                
                He hadn't seen his closest friend's little sister in years, but when she walked into his house, he was surprised.</p>
            <p>Brooks decides to investigate why Emmy returned to Meadowlark and what happened to put out the eternal fire in her eyes. But first, he needs Emmy to accept his invitation to be friends. An offer unrelated to the fact that he can't stop thinking about her.</p>
