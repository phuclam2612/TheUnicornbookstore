              <strong>The Drowning Woman</strong>
            </legend>
            <h2>By Robyn Harding</h2>
            <p>Robyn Harding is the author of several bestselling novels. She has also written and executive produced an independent film. She lives in Vancouver, British Columbia with her family and two cute but deadly rescue chihuahuas.</p>
            <h2>Book description</h2>
            <p>Lee Gulliver never expected to be living on the streets—no one does—but when her restaurant collapses and she slips deeper into debt, she abandons her previous life with only her clothing and her Toyota Corolla. In Seattle, she parks in a remote area by the beach to hide and plan her next move—until she observes a sobbing woman fling herself into the ocean early one morning. Lee drags the woman to the surface, but instead of gratitude, she is confronted with rage. Hazel, the drowning woman, tells her that she wanted to die, that she is locked in a violent, toxic marriage, and that she is a prisoner in her own house. Lee has ruined her one chance to flee her life.</p>
            <p>Hazel returns to her golden prison when she runs out of alternatives, and Lee believes she's seen the last of her until her surprise reappearance the next morning. The women form an odd bond despite their varied yet tough situations. Then, one day, Hazel makes a startling request: she wants Lee to assist her in disappearing. It'll be simple, Hazel promises her, but Lee quickly discovers that nothing is as it appears, and Hazel may not be the friend Lee thought she was.</p>
