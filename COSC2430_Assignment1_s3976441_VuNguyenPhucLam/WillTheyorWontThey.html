            <h2>By Ava WWilder</h2>
            <p>Ava Wilder is a contemporary romance writer. After spending most of her life bouncing all over the East Coast, she currently lives in Oklahoma City with her fiancé and their toothless cat. How to Fake It in Hollywood is her first novel. No one is more surprised than she is that her lifelong obsession with pop culture actually led to something useful.</p>
            <h2>Book description</h2>
            <p>At least, their characters, Lilah Hunter and Shane McCarthy, are madly in love. Lilah and Shane spent years onscreen pining for each other as the stars of the hit paranormal TV show Intangible... until Lilah left the show at the conclusion of season five in the hopes of becoming a movie star. She's back to film the much-anticipated ninth and final season, in which Lilah and Shane's characters will finally meet.


                But returning means confronting one of the main reasons she left: Shane. They've detested each other ever since their secret behind-the-scenes fling crumbled at the end of season one.</p>
            <p>They'll have to bite their teeth and play nice now that they've been reunited on set for the first time in years, with the world's eyes on them and their post-show futures on the line. But, under pressure to deliver the happy ending that Intangible fans have been waiting for, Lilah and Shane are forced to become closer than ever. And if they're not cautious, they might be caught off guard by one more twist: their own real-life happy ending.</p>
