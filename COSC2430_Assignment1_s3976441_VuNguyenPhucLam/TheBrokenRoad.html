            <h2>By Patrick Leigh Fermor</h2>
            <p>Patrick Leigh Fermor (1915/2011) was an intrepid traveler and a heroic soldier who is widely considered to be one of the finest travel writers of the twentieth century. After his stormy school days, followed by the walk across Europe to Constantinople that begins in A Time of Gifts (1977) and continues through Between the Woods and the Water (1986)  and The Broken Road (published posthumously in 2013), he  lived and traveled in the Balkans and the Greek archipelago.  His books Mani (1958) and Roumeli (1966) attest to his deep interest in languages and remote places. During the Second World War he joined the Irish Guards, became a liaison officer in Albania, and fought in Greece and Crete. He was awarded the DSO and OBE. Leigh Fermor lived partly in Greece‚Äîin the house he designed with his wife, Joan, in an olive grove in the Mani‚Äîand partly in Worcestershire. In 2004 he was knighted for his services to literature and to BritishGreek relations.</p>
            <h2>Book description</h2>
            <p>Patrick ("Paddy") Leigh Fermor, eighteen, set off on a walk across Europe in the winter of 1933, beginning in Holland and concluding in Constantinople. Decades later, in A Time of Gifts and Between the Woods and the Water, Leigh Fermor chronicled the narrative of that life-changing journey, works now regarded as among the most vivid, engaging, and beautifully written travel books of all time.</p>
            <p>The Broken Road is the long-awaited account of the final leg of his youthful adventure that Leigh Fermor promised but was unable to finish before his death in 2011. Assembled from Leigh Fermors manuscripts by his prizewinning biographer Artemis Cooper and the travel writer Colin Thubron, this is perhaps the most personal of all Leigh Fermors books, catching up with young Paddy in the fall of 1934 and following him through Bulgaria and Romania to the coast of the Black Sea. Days and nights on the road, spectacular landscapes and uncanny cities, friendships lost and found, leading the high life in Bucharest or camping out with fishermen and shepherds in the The Broken Road such incidents and escapades are described with all the linguistic bravura, odd and astonishing learning, and overflowing exuberance that Leigh Fermor is famous for, but also with a melancholy awareness of the passage of time, especially when he meditates on the scarred history of the Balkans or on his troubled relations with his father.</p>
