            <h2>By Andrea Bartz</h2>
            <p>Andrea Bartz is a Brooklyn-based journalist and the New York Times bestselling author of the Reese's Book Club pick WE WERE NEVER HERE. Her second thriller, THE HERD, was named a best book of 2020 by Real Simple, Marie Claire, Good Housekeeping, CrimeReads, and other outlets. Her LA-Times bestselling debut, THE LOST NIGHT, was optioned for TV development by Mila Kunis. It was named a best book of the year by Real Simple, Glamour, Marie Claire, Library Journal, Crime Reads, Popsugar, She Reads, and other publications.</p>
            <h2>Book description</h2>
            <p>Kelly's new life in Philadelphia has turned into a nightmare: she has no friends and no job, and the lockdown has forced her to share a tight apartment with the man she sacrificed everything for, who has just called off their wedding. Her newly repaired friendship with Sabrina, now a lovely bestselling novelist with a handsome, high-powered husband, is the only bright spot. Kelly seizes the opportunity to quit her past life when Sabrina and Nathan provide her an escape route by volunteering the spare room in their rural Virginia house. Kelly secretly falls for both of her gorgeous hosts‚Äîuntil a wild and unexpected threesome persuades the couple to open their marriage to her one night.</p>
            <p>Kelly initially enjoys being a part of this risqu√© new world. But when she learns that the last lady they asked into their marriage has gone missing, she begins to question whether they are dangerous... and if she may be next.
              The Spare Room, brimming with Andrea Bartz's typical tension, twists, and toxic connections, is an edgy, boundary-pushing new direction from the "master of the feminist thriller" (Los Angeles Times).</p>
