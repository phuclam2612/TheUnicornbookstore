            <h2>By J.C.Cervantes</h2>
            <p>J.C. Cervantes is a New York Times bestselling author of books for children and young adults. Her books have appeared on national lists, including the ABA New Voices, B&N's Best Young Reader Books, and Amazon’s Best Books of the Month. She has earned multiple awards and recognitions, including the New Mexico Book Award and the Zia Book Award. She currently resides in the Land of Enchantment with her family, three spoiled dogs, and a lifetime collection of books. When she isn’t writing, she is haunting bookstores and searching for magic in all corners of the world.</p>
            <h2>Book description</h2>
            <p>Hart Augusto and Ruby Armenta, best friends and soul mates from childhood, were about to embark on their final year together when Hart sadly drowned in a boating accident. Ruby is completely broken and unable to move on from the person she knew was her lifelong love.</p>
            <p>Hart is also unable to let go of Ruby.... He is given a second opportunity due to heavenly intervention. It won't be as simple as resurrecting Hart; instead, his soul is transplanted to the body of a local bad guy.

                When Hart returns to town as Jameson, he discovers that regaining Ruby will be more difficult than he anticipated. For one thing, he is not allowed to tell Ruby the truth.
                
                Even though she doesn't comprehend the unexpected attraction, she can't ignore it. And what is it about him that reminds her so much of Hart? Ruby begins to give her heart to Jameson, desperate to know if the connection she feels is real—but will their love be enough to cross the distance between them?</p>
