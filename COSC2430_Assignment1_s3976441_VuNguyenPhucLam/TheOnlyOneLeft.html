            <h2>By Riley Sager</h2>
            <p>Riley Sager is the New York Times bestselling author of seven novels, most recently The House Across the Lake and Survive the Night. His first novel, Final Girls, has been published in more than 30 countries and won the ITW Thriller Award for Best Hardcover Novel. His latest book, The Only One Left, will be published in 2023 by Dutton Books.</p>
            <h2>Book description</h2>
            <p>The Hope family murders, now reduced to a playground song, shook the Maine coast one horrific night in 1929. While most people believe Lenora, 17, is to blame, the authorities were never able to prove it. Apart from her denial following the killings, she has never talked publicly about that night, nor has she stepped foot outside Hope has End, the cliffside mansion where the atrocity took place.</p>
            <p>Kit McDeere, a home-health aide, comes at a deteriorating Hopes End in 1983 to care for Lenora after her previous nurse disappeared in the middle of the night. Lenora, who is in her seventies and confined to a wheelchair, was rendered dumb by a series of strokes and can only interact with Kit by typing sentences on an antique typewriter. Lenora uses it one night to make a tempting offer—"I want to tell you everything."</p>
